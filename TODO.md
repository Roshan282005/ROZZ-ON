## Implementation Details:

### 1. Database Schema Update ✓

### 4. Testing Instructions ✓
To test the implementation:

1. **Start XAMPP MySQL Service**: 
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Start MySQL service

2. **Setup Database**:
   - Run `php login/setup-database.php` to create the database and tables

3. **Test Login Functionality**:
   - Navigate to `login/login.html` in your browser
   - Test successful login with valid credentials
   - Test failed login attempts (should track attempts)
   - Test lockout after 5 failed attempts
   - Verify lockout clears after 15 minutes or successful login
   - Check dashboard shows security information

4. **Verify Dashboard**:
   - After login, check that the dashboard displays:
     - Account status (green for active, red for locked)
     - Recent failed attempts count
     - Remaining attempts before lockout
     - Security tips

The implementation is complete and ready for testing once the MySQL service is running.
